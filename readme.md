# useEffect Lab

Welcome! In this lab you will be practicing useEffect hook for the first time. This is the other most important and essential hook in react!

This lab is composed of 2 parts! Make sure you take your time understanding the requirements and to code.

## Requirements

- Please fork this repo before starting.

### Part 1

- Use useEffect to fetch [this](https://www.boredapi.com/) API.
- Make sure you fetch it only for the first time react renders and display the activity.

### Part 2

- Allow the user to pick the activity type by providing an input.
- When the user clicks on the button, it should show an activity of the type the user entered in the input field.

## The following is a video of the final result for part 2:
